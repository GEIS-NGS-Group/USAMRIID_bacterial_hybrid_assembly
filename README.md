# bacterial_hybrid_assembly
Run a docker container that assembles bacterial genomes from Illumina and MinION reads.

Open the attached powerpoint for instructions on how to run the bacterial genome assembly tutorial. This contains all the information necessary to download and run a docker container with all the necessary tools to assemble bacterial genomes from Illumina and MinION reads. It steps through an example assembly using reads contained in the docker container. 

This repository will also contain the dockerfile that can be used to generate the docker container from scratch.
